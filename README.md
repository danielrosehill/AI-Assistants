This repository contains an extensive collection of AI assistant configurations organized by category. Each assistant is configured using YAML files that contain system prompts and relevant settings. While these configurations are not directly importable into platforms like Open Web UI or Dify, they provide well-structured system prompts that can be applied to various AI models.

The assistants are organized into specialized categories including:

- Business Strategy
- Career Developmentvv
- Chat Characters
- Content Creation
- Data Analysis
- Development Tools
- Docker Management
- Education
- Entertainment
- Technical Documentation
- Workflow Automation

## Collection Status

This is an actively maintained collection of AI assistant configurations. Each assistant is carefully crafted to serve specific use cases, from practical business applications to creative and entertainment purposes. Some configurations may require specific capabilities (like vision or voice) or additional tools (RAG pipelines, external APIs) that are not included in the base configuration.

## Usage

Feel free to use these configurations in your AI platforms and projects. While many configurations will work by simply applying the system prompt to a compatible model, some may require additional setup or specific model capabilities.

## License

These configurations are freely available for use. While attribution is not required, it is appreciated when these configurations are shared or redistributed.
